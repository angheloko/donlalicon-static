Hi, I'm **Don Lalicon**, a web developer currently working in Singapore. I've worked with various languages and frameworks; Worked on both sides of the spectrum and everything in between. Recently, I've been working a lot with Drupal, PHP, Vue.js, and Nuxt.js.

I've always liked the idea of having a blog where I can share my thoughts, stories, and ideas. A way to share and flex my expertise and, at the same time, learn and improve my shortcomings.

For a start, I'll be sharing my experiences in developing this website and [Lakbay.in](https://lakbay.in), an itinerary sharing website. I developed both websites using Nuxt, Firebase, and other popular open-source libraries.

I'll also be sharing my experiences on other topics such as Drupal and PHP or anything I get to work on that I think people might find interesting in the realm of web development.

And if you're interested in the source code of this website or just want to take a peek under the hood, [it's completely open-source](https://github.com/angheloko/donlalicon)!

Stay tuned!
